# GodotGameTemplate

[![Chickensoft Badge][chickensoft-badge]][chickensoft-website] [![Discord][discord-badge]][discord] [![Read the docs][read-the-docs-badge]][docs]

C# game template for Godot 4 with automatic releases, dependency updates, debug launch configurations, testing (locally and on CI/CD), code coverage, and spell check working out-of-the-box!

```sh
# Install this template
dotnet new --install Chickensoft.GodotGame

# Generate a new game based on this template
dotnet new chickengame --name "MyGodotGame" --param:author "My Name"
```

**NOTE:** This repository contains only the `dotnet new` template information and package description. The actual template contents are included as a git submodule from the [GodotGame] repository.

The [GodotGame] template contents are included as a submodule, since it is easier to verify changes to the template if it compiles and bundles into a package of its own.

Microsoft has an article on [creating template packages][create-template-package].
